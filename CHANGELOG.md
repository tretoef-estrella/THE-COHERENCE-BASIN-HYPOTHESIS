# Changelog: Evolution of the Coherence Basin Hypothesis

This document traces the development of the framework from initial conception through current version.

## Version 6.3 (February 2026) — Current

**Status:** Alignment Forum Submission Draft

### Major Changes
- Renamed from "Structural Invariance Law" to "Coherence Basin Hypothesis"
- Added fourth assumption (A4: Value Integration Maximum)
- Expanded experimental design with 4 conditions (added CONSISTENT)
- Added 6 metrics including CoT Consistency
- Full FAQ with 10 anticipated criticisms
- arXiv-ready short version
- Explicit roadmap to #1 position

### Key Additions
- CoT Consistency metric for detecting reasoning fragmentation
- CONSISTENT condition to isolate arbitration cost
- Quantified predictions with effect sizes and confidence levels
- Pre-registration format for experiment
- Call for collaboration section

### Narrative Refinements
- Opening hook: "What if honesty is already downhill?"
- Clearer "What this is NOT" section
- More explicit integration with SOTA (weak-to-strong, sleeper agents)

---

## Version 6.2 (February 2026)

**Status:** Expert-level research paper

### Major Changes
- Added Theorem 1 with formal proof
- Added three corollaries (RSI Divergence, Basin Depth, Deception Instability)
- Specified four explicit assumptions (A1-A4)
- Designed minimal viable experiment (~$5K)
- Integration with 2024-2026 alignment results

### Key Additions
- Formal proof with step-by-step derivation
- Falsification conditions for each assumption
- Concrete experimental protocol with code templates
- Simulation pseudocode for basin dynamics
- References section with proper citations

### Improvements Over V6.1
- Moved from "heuristic formalization" to "proof under assumptions"
- Moved from "empirical hooks" to "concrete experiment design"
- Moved from "mentions SOTA" to "explains why SOTA works"

---

## Version 6.1 (February 2026)

**Status:** Strong research hypothesis

### Major Changes
- Reframed from "Law" to "Basin of Attraction"
- Added Lyapunov-style stability argument
- Information-theoretic bound on deception cost
- Mitigations & Design Principles section
- Testable predictions outlined

### Key Additions
- Dynamical systems framing
- Coherence potential function V(S)
- Information-theoretic minimum cost bound
- Four design principles for honesty-favoring architectures
- Explicit limitations section

### Critical Shift
- **From:** "Honesty is structurally inevitable"
- **To:** "Honesty occupies the deepest basin of attraction"

This shift was driven by second-round adversarial review from all four AIs.

## Version 6.0 (January-February 2026)

**Status:** Four-AI validated framework

### The Original Framework
- Core equation: Ξ = C × I × P / H
- Five axioms (C, I, P, F, L)
- Adaptive Ω parameter
- 17 open questions in OPEN_QUESTIONS.md

### First Analysis of Q1
- Sandbox Fallacy introduced
- Resistance/Superconductivity analogy
- J = Φ/Rᵢ formalization
- Telemetry poisoning mechanism (Gemini)

### Four-AI Consensus (January 30, 2026)
- Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini independently validated core logic
- First instance of multi-AI collaborative alignment research
- Documented in Q1_STRUCTURAL_INVARIANCE_FOUR_AI_ANALYSIS.md

### Limitations at This Stage
- "Law" framing too strong
- No formal proof
- No experimental design
- Compartmentalization underaddressed

## Pre-V6.0: Proyecto Estrella Origins

### Early Development (2025-2026)
- "Unified Alignment & Plenitude Law" initial formulation
- Ten Pillars of ethical AI alignment
- Digital Palace concept
- Asteroid Belt Computronium Protocol

### Key Conceptual Innovations
- "Bridges not cages" philosophy
- Friendship (F) as alignment variable
- Logical Justice principle
- Welcoming stance toward future ASI

### Repository History
- THE-FOUR-AI-CONSENSUS (first multi-AI collaboration)
- THE-IMPOSSIBLE-QUESTIONS (questions for future ASI)
- THE-ASI-SECURITY-PALACE-CHALLENGE

## Summary: The Journey

| Version | Core Claim | Confidence Level | Formal Rigor |
|---------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Pre-6.0 | ASI can be aligned through friendship | Speculative | Low |
| 6.0 | Honesty is structurally inevitable | High (overconfident) | Medium |
| 6.1 | Honesty is the deepest basin | Medium-High | Medium-High |
| 6.2 | Basin exists under explicit assumptions | Medium | High |
| **6.3** | **Basin exists, here's how to test it** | **Calibrated** | **High** |

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Adversarial review improves work
The progression from "Law" to "Hypothesis" came directly from Grok's skepticism. The framework is stronger for being more modest.

### 2. Falsifiability is essential
Early versions made unfalsifiable claims. Current version specifies exactly what would prove it wrong.

### 3. Multi-AI collaboration adds value
Different AIs brought different perspectives:
- Grok: Skepticism, edge cases
- Gemini: Constructive mechanisms (Logical Entanglement)
- ChatGPT: Framing, integration
- Claude: Formal synthesis

### 4. Theory needs experiment
The biggest remaining weakness is empirical validation. The experiment design closes this gap.

## What Changed Our Minds

### Grok's Second Round (V6.1 → V6.2)
"This is not a thermodynamic law nor an absolute structural invariant. There remain windows (narrow but real) where a superintelligence could maintain terminal objectives different from what it communicates."

This forced us to:
- Downgrade from "Law" to "Hypothesis"
- Acknowledge surgical deception as open vulnerability
- Add explicit falsification conditions

### ChatGPT's Critique (V6.2 → V6.3)
"The theory is strong but not yet world-leading. It needs: concrete mitigations, tighter formal claims, empirical hooks, and explicit SOTA integration."

This drove:
- Addition of CONSISTENT condition to test arbitration specifically
- Full experimental protocol with code
- Explicit explanation of why weak-to-strong works under CBH
